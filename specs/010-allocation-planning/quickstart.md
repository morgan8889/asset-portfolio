# Quickstart: Allocation Planning

## Overview
The Allocation Planning feature helps you visualize your portfolio's composition, set target allocations, and generate rebalancing instructions.

## Usage

### Viewing Current Allocation
1. Navigate to the **Allocation** page.
2. View the **Asset Class** donut chart to see your current breakdown (e.g., 60% Stock, 40% Bond).
3. Switch tabs to view breakdown by **Sector** or **Region**.
4. **Note:** Unclassified assets appear as a grey slice. Click it to update their category.

### Setting Targets
1. Click **"Set Targets"** or **"Manage Models"**.
2. Create a new model (e.g., "Retirement 2040").
3. Use the sliders to set percentages for each asset class (must sum to 100%).
4. Click **Save**.

### Rebalancing
1. Select your active **Target Model** from the dropdown.
2. Scroll to the **Rebalancing Plan** section.
3. Review the **Drift** column to see deviations.
4. Follow the **Action** items (Buy/Sell) to realign your portfolio.
5. *Optional*: Toggle **"Exclude Locked Accounts"** to ignore 401ks or other restricted accounts from the plan.
